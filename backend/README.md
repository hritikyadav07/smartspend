- Provide APIs for the frontend
- Manage categories and reports

## Planned Structure
- `routes/` - API endpoints
- `models/` - Database models/schemas
- `controllers/` - Business logic
- `middleware/` - Authentication, validation, etc.
- `config/` - Configuration files (database, environment)

## Setup (to be updated)
- Likely stack: Node.js with Express (or similar)
